We use D Style (http://dlang.org/dstyle.html) where not specified otherwise,
and Ddoc (http://dlang.org/ddoc.html) comments are used to document code.

The things in which we willingly deviate from D Style are:
1) indentation is 8 spaces
2) braces are always
   word {
           /* content */
   }

Used keywords / attributes
---------------------------
We currently don't use the following keywords / attributes not to overly bloat the code:
@trusted
@nogc
@nothrow
pure (except for very small and plainly 'functional' functions)
scope (as a storage class; but we *do* use 'in')
